TurboDrawMaster
===============
_Pixel art drawing reimagined_

##The idea

TurboDrawMaster is a pixel drawing application project that aims to minimize redundant UI interaction and to fill your monitor with the actual artwork, not menu screens. Dialogs such as color and tool choices are implemented using screen overlays bound to hotkeys. For example, hold Q to fill the screen with a color picker and click the color you want. As soon as you let go of the hotkey, you're back drawing artwork.
